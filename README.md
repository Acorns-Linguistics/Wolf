Software to create indigenous dictionaries (Word Oriented Linguistic Framework - WOLF

WOLF provides a framework for creating indigenous dictionaries. The software supports dictionaries with multiple languages and dialects, searching and sorting, import and export facilities, generation of web-pages and pdf documents, integration with the ACORNS mobile gallery applications, multimedia attachments, and IPA phonetics. It can import dictionaries originally created using EXCEL, SIL's MDF format, and in LIFT. The interface has an EXCEL feel, but geared for use by linguists.
