Software to create indigenous dictionaries (Word Oriented Linguistic Framework) - WOLF

WOLF provides a framework for creating indigenous dictionaries. The software supports dictionaries with multiple languages and dialects, searching and sorting, import and export facilities, generation of web-pages and pdf documents, integration with the ACORNS mobile gallery applications, multimedia attachments, and IPA phonetics. It can import dictionaries originally created using EXCEL, SIL's MDF format, and in LIFT. The Wolf application interface has an EXCEL feel, but geared for use by linguists. 

Installation: The repository's main downloaded zip file is an Eclipse-based Java project. The Wolf_lib directory contains the necessary jar and library files for use on a Windows system. Included among these files are those needed by JavaFX. These JavaFX jars and libraries are only required if you plan to attach video clips to created dictionary words and definitions. If you plan to run the Wolf application on Mac or Linux systems, you'll need to download open source JavaFX and replace the respective files with those that apply to the appripriate platform.
